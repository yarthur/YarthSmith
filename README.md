>A Node-based static site generator. Yep, another one.

The world doesn't need more static site generators, but John Arthur was itching to create one as a way for him to expand his JS capabilities.

Though, if I know John Arthur, it won't go anywhere. And since I am John...

## Install

## Maintainer
[John Arthur](https://github.com/yarthur)

## Contribute
If this is a thing that interests you, I encourage you to go and make something better. This, as of right now, is the fever-dream of a man who will not have the time to take it anywhere, and though I appreciate the offer, I don't want to let you down when I can't get 'round to it.

With that, if I didn't sway you, please feel free to [log issues](https://github.com/yarthur/yarthsmith/issues), or even fork and [PR](https://github.com/yarthur/dotfiles/compare?expand=1). As of right now, there are no tests, nor any strict style guidelines, and if that changes, it'll be me to put everything into compliance before I yell at anyone else.
